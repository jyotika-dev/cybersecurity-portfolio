## vi/vim Editor Fundamentals

### Modal Editing Concept

- **Normal Mode** → command execution and navigation
- **Insert Mode** → text input and editing
- Press `i` to enter Insert Mode
- Press `Esc` to return to Normal Mode

### Basic File Operations

```bash
vi test.txt           # Create/open file
:w                    # Save (write) file
:wq                   # Save and quit
:q!                   # Quit without saving
```

### Navigation Commands

```bash
gg                    # Jump to beginning of file
G                     # Jump to end of file
h                     # Move left
j                     # Move down
k                     # Move up
l                     # Move right
```

### Text Editing Commands

```bash
i                     # Insert mode at cursor
o                     # Open new line below and insert
dw                    # Delete word
/pattern              # Search forward for pattern
n                     # Next search result
```

### vimtutor

- Interactive tutorial built into vim
- 25-30 minute self-paced learning
- Practice commands in safe environment
- Run with: `vimtutor`

## nano Editor Fundamentals

### User-Friendly Features

- No modal interface → immediate text input
- On-screen keyboard shortcuts
- Beginner-friendly design
- `^` symbol represents Ctrl key

### Basic Commands

```bash
nano welcome.txt      # Create/open file
Ctrl+O               # Save (WriteOut)
Ctrl+X               # Exit editor
Ctrl+W               # Search (Where is)
Ctrl+_               # Go to line number
Ctrl+A               # Beginning of line
Ctrl+E               # End of line
```

**Note:** In Firefox, Ctrl+W closes tabs. Use Chrome/Edge or disable in about:config

## When to Use Each Editor

### Use nano when:

- New to Linux text editing
- Making quick, simple configuration changes
- Prefer straightforward, intuitive interface
- Occasional text editing needs

### Use vi/vim when:

- Extensive programming or text manipulation
- Working on remote servers (vi always available)
- Need advanced features (macros, plugins, search/replace)
- Efficiency and speed are priorities

## Practical Application in Cybersecurity

### System Administration:

- Edit configuration files (`/etc/hosts`, `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`)
- Modify security policies and firewall rules
- Quick log file analysis and editing

### Incident Response:

- Rapid file inspection on compromised systems
- Log file manipulation and analysis
- Creating incident notes and documentation

### Penetration Testing:

- Script creation and modification
- Payload customization
- Tool configuration editing

### Remote Server Management:

- SSH sessions often only have vi/vim available
- Emergency system recovery and repair
- Configuration changes without GUI access
