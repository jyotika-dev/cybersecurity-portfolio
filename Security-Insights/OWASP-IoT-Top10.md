# 🔐 OWASP IoT Top 10 – Insights

The **OWASP IoT Top 10** highlights the most critical security issues in Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems.  
IoT devices are widely deployed across industries, but their rapid adoption often comes with overlooked security fundamentals.

---

## 📌 Why This Matters
- IoT devices handle **sensitive data** (e.g., healthcare, industrial control, smart homes).  
- A single weak device can become an **entry point** for attackers to compromise entire networks.  
- Security risks are often **basic** but have **massive real-world impact**.

## 🔎 My Key Insights on the IoT Top 10

### 1️⃣ Weak, Guessable, or Hardcoded Passwords
- Default or hardcoded credentials make devices easy to compromise.  
- 🔑 *My reflection*: Even my old router had default admin credentials until I changed them.  
- **Impact**: Attackers don’t need “0-days” when weak passwords open the door.  

---

### 2️⃣ Insecure Network Services
- Many IoT devices run unnecessary or vulnerable services (Telnet, FTP).  
- 🔍 *Insight*: A simple port scan can reveal attack surfaces.  
- **Impact**: These services can enable DoS or remote takeover.  

---

### 3️⃣ Insecure Ecosystem Interfaces
- Web, API, and mobile interfaces often lack strong authentication, rate limiting, or proper validation.  
- 📱 *Insight*: APIs are often rushed to production without proper security checks.  
- **Impact**: Attackers can bypass controls and directly interact with backend systems.  

---

### 4️⃣ Lack of Secure Update Mechanism
- Many devices cannot be patched or rely on insecure update channels.  
- 🚨 *Insight*: “Unpatchable” devices = **permanent vulnerabilities**.  
- **Impact**: Threat actors exploit old firmware for years (e.g., Mirai botnet).  

---

### 5️⃣ Use of Insecure or Outdated Components
- IoT devices often use outdated libraries or third-party components.  
- ⚠️ *Insight*: Once shipped, vendors rarely update open-source dependencies.  
- **Impact**: An entire device fleet may share the same exploitable vulnerability.  

---

### 6️⃣ Insufficient Privacy Protection
- IoT devices collect large amounts of personal data (voice, health, location).  
- 🕵️ *Insight*: Privacy breaches aren’t just technical — they are compliance & trust risks.  
- **Impact**: Compromised privacy = surveillance, profiling, identity theft.  

---

### 7️⃣ Insecure Data Transfer and Storage
- Data is often sent or stored unencrypted.  
- 📡 *Insight*: A packet capture (PCAP) can expose sensitive info if TLS is not enforced.  
- **Impact**: Stolen credentials, location leaks, and corporate espionage.  

---

### 8️⃣ Lack of Device Management
- Organizations deploy thousands of IoT devices but fail at inventory, monitoring, and control.  
- 💡 *Insight*: “You can’t protect what you don’t know exists.”  
- **Impact**: Forgotten devices = unmonitored backdoors.  

---

### 9️⃣ Insecure Default Settings
- Devices often ship with insecure configurations enabled by default.  
- 🔧 *Insight*: Security should be **opt-out**, not opt-in.  
- **Impact**: Misconfigured devices are exploited before users even set them up.  

---

### 🔟 Lack of Physical Hardening
- Many IoT devices can be tampered with physically (debug ports, USB access).  
- 🛠️ *Insight*: In labs and factories, physical access = firmware dumping = full compromise.  
- **Impact**: Attackers bypass software controls entirely.  

---

## 💡 Takeaways
- **For Beginners** → The OWASP IoT Top 10 is the best starting point to understand IoT security gaps.  
- **For Professionals** → Even advanced systems fail at basics. Strong fundamentals = resilient infrastructure.
