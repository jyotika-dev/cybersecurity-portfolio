# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

<img width="834" height="783" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58c76b35-4434-4008-9cc3-ce05a6d51efc" />

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks effectively.

It offers organizations a flexible, outcome-based structure to assess and manage cybersecurity risks, regardless of their size, sector, location, or technical maturity.

The framework outlines "what" organizations should achieve (outcomes) but does not prescribe "how" to achieve them—practical controls and guides are provided separately.

It helps prioritize actions, improve communication about risks, and support continuous improvement in cybersecurity posture.

## Cybersecurity Framework Overview

The framework includes the following components:

- **CSF Core**
- **CSF Organizational Profiles**
- **CSF Tiers**

---

## Introduction to the CSF Core

### What is CSF Core?

The **CSF Core** is the main section containing all the recommended cybersecurity outcomes, organized in a hierarchy.

**Structure:**
- **Functions:** GOVERN, IDENTIFY, PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, RECOVER
- **Categories:** Collection of related outcomes under each Function
- **Subcategories:** Specific, actionable outcomes under each category

---

### The Six Functions

**GOVERN:** Set strategies, policies, roles, responsibilities, oversight, supply chain risk management

**IDENTIFY:** Know your assets, threats, risks, and improvement needs

**PROTECT:** Implement safeguards—access controls, data security, system resilience, training

**DETECT:** Find possible cyber events quickly through monitoring or analysis

**RESPOND:** Manage and communicate incident handling and mitigation

**RECOVER:** Restore systems and communicate after an incident

---

### How They Work Together

- Actions that support **GOVERN, IDENTIFY, PROTECT, DETECT** should all happen continuously
- Actions that support **RESPOND and RECOVER** should be ready at all times and happen when cybersecurity events occur
- **GOVERN** is at the center of the "wheel", directing priorities for the rest

## Introduction to CSF Profiles

### What is a Profile?

A profile describes an organization's current or target cybersecurity posture regarding the CSF outcomes.

**Types of Profiles:**

**Current Profile:** Specifies the outcomes that an organization is currently achieving (or attempting to achieve) and characterizes how or to what extent each outcome is being achieved

**Target Profile:** The desired outcomes to aim to achieve for your risk objectives

**Community Profile:** Baseline for a group/sector, used to guide Target Profiles

---

### How to Use Profiles?

1. Define the **scope of the Organizational Profile**
2. **Gather the information** needed to prepare the Organizational Profile
3. **Create the Organizational Profile**
4. **Analyze the gaps** between the Current and Target Profiles, and create an action plan
5. **Implement the action plan**, and update the Organizational Profile

---

## Introduction to CSF Tiers

### What are Tiers?

**Tiers** characterize how rigorously an organization manages its cybersecurity risks (governance and controls).

They provide context on how organizations view cybersecurity risks and the processes in place to manage those risks.

---

### Four Tier Levels

**TIER 1 - Partial:**  
Ad-hoc, limited awareness, no organization-wide approach

**TIER 2 - Risk Informed:**  
Some policies exist, better awareness, not fully organization-wide

**TIER 3 - Repeatable:**  
Formally defined policies, practices, and reviews shared organization-wide

**TIER 4 - Adaptive:**  
Fully integrated, agile, and continuously improving; responsive to risk and threat changes

---

## Supplemental Online Resources

NIST and other organizations have produced a suite of online resources that help organizations understand, adopt, and use the CSF effectively.

**Informative References:** Mappings showing how CSF outcomes align with standards, laws, or best practices controls  
*Examples: NIST SP 800-53, COBIT, ISO*

**Implementation Examples:** Illustrative practical examples of how organizations can achieve CSF outcomes

**Quick Start Guides (QSGs):** Short guides focused on helping organizations begin implementation or understand specific parts of the CSF

These supplemental resources aid in practical adoption and bridge CSF concepts with existing organizational processes.

## Improving Cybersecurity Risk Communication and Integration

- Using the CSF to improve communication between executives, managers, and practitioners
- Aligning cybersecurity with broader enterprise risk management (ERM)
- Ensuring consistent flow of risk-related information for better decision-making and accountability

---

## Cybersecurity and Privacy Risk Relationship

- How cybersecurity risk management supports privacy risk management
- Use of NIST Privacy Framework in conjunction with CSF to address privacy concerns comprehensively

---

## Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)

- Critical emphasis on managing cybersecurity risks in supply chains
- Subcategories and guidance for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks from suppliers, vendors, and partners

---

## Emerging Technology Risks

- Inclusion of risks from emerging technologies like AI
- Guidance to treat such risks integrated with other enterprise risks for holistic cybersecurity management
