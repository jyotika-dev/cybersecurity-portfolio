# **ISO 27001**

## **What is ISO 27001?**

- **ISO 27001** is an internationally recognized standard for **information security management**. It helps organizations systematically protect data, control risks, and meet legal requirements.
- It is built around an **Information Security Management System (ISMS) —** a set security policies, procedures, and controls covering people, processes, and technology.
- It’s purpose is to protect confidential data and assure customer, partners, and regulators that all good security practices are in place.

## How does ISO 27001 work?

The focus of **ISO 27001** is to protect the **CIA Triad — Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability** of information in a company. This is done by finding out what potential incidents could happen to the information (eg - risk assessment), and then defining what needs to be done from preventing those incidents from happening (eg - risk mitigation), and systematically treat them through security controls (safeguards)

---

## What are ISO 27001 Controls?

The **ISO 27001 Controls** (also known as safeguards) are the practices to be implemented to reduce the acceptable risk levels.

Controls can be **technological**, **organizational**, **physical**, or **human-related**.

---

## **ISO 27001:2022 Control Structure (Annex A)**

1. **Organizational Controls (38 Controls)**
    - **What:** These are governance and policy-level controls set by management to create a strong security foundation across the company.
    - **Examples:** Security policy, asset management, access management, incident response process, supplier controls, and overall roles/responsibilities
    - **Why important:** Ensure there are clear rules, ownership, and communication about security, so that everyone is aligned on expectations and processes.
2. **People Controls (8 Controls)**
    - **What:** Controls centered on people’s roles from hiring to ongoing awareness and secure behaviour.
    - **Examples:** Pre-employment screening, security awareness training, remote work policies, and processes for reporting incidents
    - **Why important:** Reduces human errors, insider threats and ensures everyone knows their security duties,
3. **Physical Controls (14 Controls)**
    - **What:** Measures to secure premises, devices, and the physical environment
    - **Examples:** Physical security perimeters — guards, cameras, bollards, locks, clear desk/screen policies, media disposal, and protecting workspace.
    - **Why important:** Stops physical theft, unauthorised building access, and ensures safety of information outside IT systems.
4. **Technological Controls (34 Controls)**
    - **What:** Controls embedded in IT infrastructure, networks, and software.
    - **Examples:** Malware and antivirus defences, secure data backups, monitoring and logging, cryptography, network segregation, secure software development, and cloud security
    - **Why important:** Protect digital assets from cyberattacks, ensures data reliability and supports business continuity.

## Components of ISO 27001

1. **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**
    - **ISMS** is a structured set of rules, policies, procedures, and controls created to protect an organization’s information — people, processes, and technology — by managing risks efficiently.
    - It provides a systematic, company-wide approach to information security that aligns with business objectives.
2. **Risk Assessment and Management**
    - **ISO 27001** requires an organization to identify risks to confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA), assess their likelihood and impact, and decide how to treat each risk (risk mitigation, avoid, transfer, accept).
    - The process results in risk register and prioritized security actions.
3. **Statement of Applicability (SoA)**
    - The **SOA** is a key document listing all 93 controls in ISO 27001:2022 (Annex A), showing which are used, which are not and why.
    - It justifies choices based on risk assessment, proving a thoughful, tailored approach to regulators/auditors.
4. **Continual Review and Improvement**
    - **ISO 27001** uses the **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)** cycle — regular reviews, audits, management meetings and process updates.
    - Continuous improvements makes sure security stays effective and adapts to new threats, business changes, or tech.

## Risk Management Requirements

### **Core ISO 27001 Risk Management Steps**

1. **Define Risk Assessment Methodolgy**
    - Decides how risk will be identified, analyzed, evaluated, and documented
    - Specify criteria for risk assessment such as likelihood, impact, who owns the risk, and how “acceptable risk” is determined.
2. **Identify Risks**
    - Identify risks to confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information
    - Risks come from internal and external sources
3. **Analyze and Evaluate Risks**
    - Use the risk matrix to prioritize risk responses
    - Document clear criteria so it’s easy to compare risks and review later
4. **Risk Treatment**
    - Select options: **Reduce** (implement controls), **Avoid** (stop risky activities), **Transfer** (e.g., insurance), or **Accept** (risk is low and manageable).
    - Use Annex A controls to guide decisions and develop your security action plan (Risk Treatment Plan).
5. **Statement of Applicability (SoA)**
    - Document all controls considered — showing which were implemented, which weren’t and why, based on your risk assessment.
    - SoA is a key document required for ISO 27001 certification and audits
6. **Monitor, Review, and Continual Improvement**
    - Security is dynamic: update risk status, procedures, and controls often.
    - Continuous review keeps the ISMS relevant and effective.

## **ISO 27001 Certification Process**

To achieve **ISO 27001 Certification** organizations must:

1. **Define Scope of the ISMS**
    - Scope sets boundaries — certification only applies to the areas and processes included.
2. **Conduct a Risk Assessment and Select Controls**
    - Thorough risk assessment ensures the right controls are in place and no major gaps are missed.
3. **Develop Required Documentation (Policies, Procedures, SoA)**
    - Proper documentation is evidence of compliance — required for internal and external audits
4. **Implement Controls and Assign Responsibilities**
    - Put the chosen controls in action (Technical, Organizational, Physical, People)
    - Assign owners and responsible persons for each controls to maintain accountability
5. **Internal Audits and Management Reviews**
    - Internal checks catch and fix problems before external auditor visit
6. **Two-Stage External Audit (by Certification Body)**
    - **Stage 1:** Auditor reviews documentations and readiness. Gives feedbacks on what needs fixing.
    - **Stage 2:** Auditor tests implementation, interviews staffs, checks records observe real operations. Certification is granted if compliant.
7. **Ongoing Compliance**
    - Certification is valid for 3 years.
    - **Annual surveillance audits:** Short check-ups by auditors to make sure ISMS is working.
    - **Re-certification audit** at the end of 3 years: Full review for renewal.

## ISO 27001:2022 – Link to Other Frameworks (NIST CSF, GDPR, Global Compatibility)

### Core Idea

ISO 27001 is globally recognized for information security management and **integrates well with other major frameworks** like NIST CSF and data privacy regulations like GDPR, making it highly valuable for organizations with international or cross-industry needs.

1. **ISO 27001 and NIST CSF**
    - **Compatibility:** Both promote risk-based security, management commitment, continual improvement, and strong documentation.
    - **Mapping:** Many ISO 27001 Annex A controls can be mapped directly to NIST CSF’s core functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).
    - **Why integrate?** Organizations use NIST CSF as a practical “what to do” framework (especially in the US) and prove their practices through ISO 27001’s certification, gaining formal recognition worldwide.
    
    **Example:** A US company uses NIST CSF for operational cybersecurity and ISO 27001 to achieve formal certification recognized by global customers.
    
2. **ISO 27001 and GDPR**
    - **Data privacy focus:** ISO 27001 provides a strong foundation for GDPR compliance, covering asset management, access controls, incident response, and documentation—core GDPR requirements.
    - **Overlap:** Both require risk assessment, management controls, and regular audits. ISO 27001 certification demonstrates a proactive, accountable approach to protecting personal data and managing data processing risks.
    - **Why integrate?** Accelerates audit readiness for privacy laws and simplifies third-party (vendor) compliance.
    
    **Example:** An EU fintech implements ISO 27001 to address GDPR’s Article 32 (security of processing), reducing regulatory risk and customer concerns.
    
3. **Global and Cross-Framework Benefits**
    - **Broad acceptance:** ISO 27001 is a preferred global certification for tenders, mergers, and business partnerships.
    - **Streamlines compliance:** Makes it easier to show due diligence for HIPAA, SOC 2, or PCI DSS by aligning controls and documentation with ISO 27001’s structure.
    - **Efficient audits:** Mapping ISO 27001 to NIST CSF (or other frameworks) reduces duplication and helps automate compliance evidence.
