# Policy Hierarchy

**Policy > Standard > Procedure > Guideline**

## Core Components

* **Policy:** 'What and Why'. High level rule that must be followed.  
  *Example:* All sensitive data must be encrypted.

* **Standard:** 'What Exactly'. The specific requirement that supports the policy.  
  *Example:* Encryption must be done using AES-256 method.

* **Procedure:** 'How to Do it'. Step-by-step instructions to follow the standard.  
  *Example:* Steps to follow while enabling AES-256 encryption in the database.

* **Guideline:** 'Recommended Way'. Best practices or helpful advices.  
  *Example:* Using passwords with more than 12 characters.

These work in top-down structure to ensure consistency, clarity and accountability for the security measures.
