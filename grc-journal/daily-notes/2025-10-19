# Risk Appetite, Tolerance and Mitigation Strategies

### Core Components

- **Risk Appetite:**
    - It is the overall risk an organization is willing to take in order to achieve its goals before corrective action is needed.
    - Expressed as a balance between opportunity (growth) and safety (security).
    - Set by senior leadership and linked to business strategy.
    - Example- A company should have high risk appetite for innovation but low risk appetite for data breaches.
- **Risk Tolerance:**
    - It is the acceptable variation from risk appetite based of specific circumstances or metrics
    - Represents how much deviation or exposure is allowed in each risk area
    - Example- If the security team has a limit of two phishing incidents per year, that is their tolerance within the bigger company’s appetite for accepting moderate risk overall
- **Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
    - These are the actions taken to manage and control risks so they are within the appetite and tolerance limits.
    - Common Strategies:
        - Avoid: discontinue insecure service
        - Reduce: patch systems or enhance monitoring
        - Transfer: cyber insurance
        - Accept: acknowledge residual risks as within appetite

Together, they create a structured and measurable approach in managing enterprise risks and compliances.

### Real-World Example

A cloud service company wants to launch new features

- Risk Appetite: The company is willing to accept moderate security risks to rapidly release innovations
- Risk Tolerance: For example, they accept up to two minor security incidents but none that impact customer data
- Mitigation Strategies: They implement additional monitoring, staff training, and automated vulnerability scans to keep risks within the acceptable limits.

# Risk Register Structure

### Key Purpose

A **Risk Register** is a structured document used to record, track, and manage risks systematically.

Regular updates and clear accountability make it a living, useful tool — not just a static document

### Core Components

- **Risk ID:** A unique identifier to track the risk. (RSK-001)
- **Risk Description:** A concise statement describing the potential event or cause of risk.
- **Category:** The type of risk. (example: cybersecurity, compliance, operational, financial)
- **Likelihood & Impact Scores:** Quantify risk severity using numercial values or qualitative levels. (example: Low, Medium, High)
- **Risk Score:** Product of likelihood x impact, helping to prioritize risk.
- **Risk Owner:** Person accountable for monitoring and managing risks.
- **Mitigation Strategy / Controls:** Actions to reduce the probability or impact of risks. (example: patching, backups, staff training)
- **Status / Progress:** Indicates the current state of risk — Open, Closed, In Progress.
- **Residual Risk:** Remaining risk after mitigation actions.
- **Review Dates:** Track when the risk was last and next evaluated.
- **Sample Risk Register**:
    
    
    | **Risk ID** | **Description** | **Category** | **Likelihood** | **Impact** | **Score** | **Mitigation** | **Owner** | **Status** |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | RSK-001 | Data breach via phishing | Cybersecurity | High | Severe | 20 | Employee training, Email filters | IT Security | Open |
    | RSK-002 | Server downtime | Operational  | Medium | Moderate  | 9 | Regular maintainence, cloud redundancy | IT Ops | In Progress |
    | RSK-003 | Non-Compliance with GDPR | Compliance | Medium | High | 16 | Policy review, encryption access control | Compliance Office | Open |

### Real-World Example

Consider a cybersecurity team in a software company using a risk register to track threats like phishing, data breaches and downtime

Each risk is logged with key details like — its description, ID, likelihood, impact, mitigation and who owns the responsibility. This register helps the team continuously monitor and control their top risks.
