# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

![image.png](attachment:79171aa0-fd72-4fe3-aa7a-cea757eee58e:image.png)

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** provides guidance to industry, government agencies and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks.

It provides organizations a flexible, outcome-based structure to assess and manage cybersecurity risks, regardless of their size, sector, location, or technical maturity.

It outlines “what” organizations should achieve (outcomes) but does not prescribe “how” to achieve them, practical controls and guides are provided separately.

The Framework help prioritize actions, improve communication about risks and support continuous improvement

## **Cybersecurity Framework Overview**

It includes the following components:

- **CSF Core**
- **CSF Organizational Profiles**
- **CSF Tiers**

---

## **Introduction to the CSF Core**

### **What is CSF Core?**

The **CSF Core** is the main section containing all the recommended cybersecurity outcomes, organized in a hierarchy.

- **Functions:** GOVERN, IDENTIFY, PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, RECOVER
- **Categories:** Collection of related outcomes under each Function.
- **Subcategories:** Specific, actionable outcomes under each category.

### **The Six Functions**

- **GOVERN:** Set strategies, policies, roles, responsibilities, oversight, supply chain risk management.
- **IDENTIFY:** Know your asset, threats, risk, improvement needs
- **PROTECT:** Implement safeguards — access controls, data security, system resilience, training
- **DETECT:** Find possible cyber events quickly by monitoring or analysis
- **RESPOND:** Manage and communicate incident handling and mitigation
- **RECOVER:** Restore systems and communicate after an incident

### **How They Work Together**

- Actions that support — GOVERN, IDENTIFY, PROTECT, DETECT — should all happen continuously
- Actions that support — RESPOND and RECOVER — should be ready at all times and happen when cybersecurity event occurs
- GOVERN is at the centre of the “wheel”, directing priorities for the rest

## **Introduction to CSF Profiles**

### **What is a Profile?**

- It describes an organization’s current or target cybersecurity posture regarding the CSF outcomes
- **Current Profile:** It specifies the outcomes that an organization is currently achieving (or attempting to achieve) and characterizes how or to what extent each outcome is being achieved.
- **Target Profile:** It is the desired outcomes to aim to achieve for your risk objectives
- **Community Profile:** Baseline for a group/sector, used to guide Target Profiles

### **How to Use Profiles?**

1. **Scope of the Organizational Profile**
2. **Gather the information needed to prepare the Organizational Profile**
3. **Create the Organizational Profile**
4. **Analyze the gaps between the Current and Target Profiles, and create an action plan**
5. **Implement the action plan, and update the Organizational Profile**

## **Introduction to CSF Tiers**

### What are Tiers?

- **Tiers** characterizes how rigorously an organization manages its cybersecurity risks (governance  and controls)
- They provide context how organizations views cybersecurity risks and processes in place to manage those risks.
- **Four Levels:**
    - **TIER 1 -** Partial: Ad-hoc, limited awareness, no org-wide approach
    - **TIER 2 -** Risk Informed: Some policies, better awareness, not fully org-wide
    - **TIER 3 -** Repeatable: Formally defined policies, practices, and reviews shared org-wide
    - **TIER 4 -** Adaptive: Fully integrated, agile, and continuously improving; responsive to risk and threat  changes

## Supplemental Online Resources

NIST and other organizations have produced a suite of online resources that help organizations understand, adopt, use the CSF.

- **Informative References:** These are mappings showing how CSF outcomes align with standards, laws, or best practices controls. Example: NIST SP 800-53, COBIT, ISO.
- **Implementation Examples:** Illustrative practical examples of how organizations can achieve CSF outcomes.
- **Quick Start Guides (QSGs):** Short guides focused on helping organizations begin the implementation or understand specific part of the CSF

Including these supplemental resources aids in practical adoption and bridges CSF concepts with existing organizational processes.

---

## **Improving Cybersecurity Risk Communication and Integration**

- How to use the CSF to improve communication between executives, managers, and practitioners.
- Aligning cybersecurity with broader enterprise risk management (ERM).
- Ensures consistent flow of risk-related information for better decision-making and accountability.

---

## Cybersecurity and Privacy Risk Relationship

- How cybersecurity risk management supports privacy risk management
- Use of NIST Privacy Framework in conjunction with CSF to address privacy concerns comprehensively

---

## Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)

- Critical emphasis on managing cybersecurity risks in supply chains
- Subcategories and guidance for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks from suppliers, vendors, and partners.

---

## Emerging Technology Risks

- Inclusion of risks from emerging technology like AI
- Guidance to treat such risks integrated with other enterprise risks for holistic cybersecurity
