# Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC)

## What is GRC and How They Interact?

Let's say a large IT industry needs to:
* Set rules and responsibilities for how it operates ⇒ **Governance**
* Identify threats/risks like fraud or cyber attacks ⇒ **Risk Management**
* Follow laws protecting client data and employee details ⇒ **Compliance**

All these unite to form a GRC program to run a firm smoothly and reduce risks.
