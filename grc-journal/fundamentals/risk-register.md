# Risk Register - Tracking and Managing Risks

> A structured way to document, track, and manage organizational risks

## What is a Risk Register?

A risk register is a living document that records all identified risks and tracks them over time. It helps teams stay organized and accountable for managing threats.

**Important:** It's not a one-time document - it needs regular updates to stay useful.

## Key Components in a Risk Register

### Risk ID
A unique identifier for tracking the risk.
- Format: RSK-001, RSK-002, etc.

### Risk Description
A clear, concise statement of the potential problem.
- Example: "Data breach via phishing attack"

### Category
The type of risk. Common categories:
- Cybersecurity
- Compliance
- Operational
- Financial
- Reputational

### Likelihood Score
How likely is the risk to happen?
- Low, Medium, High
- Or numerical: 1-5 scale

### Impact Score
How bad would it be if it happened?
- Low, Medium, High
- Or numerical: 1-5 scale

### Risk Score
Calculated as: Likelihood Ã— Impact
- Helps prioritize which risks need immediate attention

### Risk Owner
The person responsible for managing this risk.
- Must be named and accountable

### Mitigation Strategy / Controls
What actions are being taken to reduce the risk?
- Example: Employee training, firewalls, backups

### Status
Current state of the risk:
- Open (active risk being managed)
- In Progress (mitigation is underway)
- Closed (risk resolved)

### Residual Risk
The remaining risk after mitigation actions are taken.
- Not all risk can be eliminated

### Review Dates
When the risk was last reviewed and when it's due for review again.
- Ensures regular monitoring

## How to Use This Register

### Step 1: Identify Risks
Brainstorm potential threats and problems that could impact the organization.

### Step 2: Document
Add each risk to the register with ID, description, category, and owner.

### Step 3: Score
Assign likelihood and impact scores. Calculate the risk score.

### Step 4: Prioritize
Focus on risks with highest scores first.

### Step 5: Mitigate
Develop and implement strategies to reduce each risk.

### Step 6: Monitor
Review regularly (monthly or quarterly). Update status and residual risk.

### Step 7: Update
As risks change or are resolved, keep the register current.

## Real-World Example

A software company's cybersecurity team tracks threats:

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Score | Action | Owner | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| Phishing emails | High | High | 20 | Training + filters | Security Team | Open |
| Unpatched systems | Medium | High | 16 | Auto-patching | IT Ops | In Progress |
| Weak passwords | High | Moderate | 12 | MFA rollout | IT Ops | Open |

Each week, they review: Did we complete the planned actions? Is anything new? Have any risks improved or worsened?

## Tips for Success

- Keep it simple but detailed enough to be useful
- Update it regularly (at least monthly)
- Make sure risk owners are named and engaged
- Review with your team, not just alone
- Connect risks to business strategy
- Track what mitigation actions actually worked

## Why This Matters

A good risk register helps you:
- Know what could go wrong
- Prioritize what to fix first
- Track who's responsible
- Measure progress
- Make informed decisions

It turns risk management from vague concerns into a concrete, measurable process.
