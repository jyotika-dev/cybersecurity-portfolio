# Risk Management - A Quick Guide

> Understanding Risk Appetite, Tolerance, and Mitigation

## What is Risk Management?

Risk management is about identifying potential problems and taking steps to handle them before they become actual problems. It helps organizations stay safe while still achieving their goals.

## The Three Core Concepts

### 1. Risk Appetite

This is how much risk an organization is willing to take to achieve its goals before taking action to stop it.

Think of it as the organization's overall comfort level with risk.

**Example:**
- High appetite for innovation risks = Company wants to launch new features fast
- Low appetite for security risks = Company doesn't want data breaches

**Key Point:** Set by senior leadership and linked to business strategy.

---

### 2. Risk Tolerance

This is how much variation or deviation from risk appetite is acceptable for specific situations.

It's more specific than appetite - it sets actual limits.

**Example:**
- Risk Appetite: "We accept moderate security risk overall"
- Risk Tolerance: "But we allow maximum 2 phishing incidents per year"

**Key Point:** Defines acceptable exposure in each risk area with measurable limits.

### 3. Risk Mitigation Strategies

These are the actual actions taken to manage and control risks. Four common approaches:

**Avoid** - Stop the risky activity entirely
- Example: Discontinue an insecure service

**Reduce** - Make the risk smaller
- Example: Patch systems, add monitoring, staff training

**Transfer** - Move the risk to someone else
- Example: Buy cyber insurance

**Accept** - Acknowledge the risk as acceptable
- Example: Accept remaining risks that fall within appetite limits

---

## Real-World Example

A cloud service company launches new features:

- **Risk Appetite:** Moderate security risk acceptable for fast innovation
- **Risk Tolerance:** Maximum 2 minor incidents allowed, zero data breaches
- **Mitigation Strategy:** Add monitoring, staff training, automated scans

Result: Features launch safely within acceptable risk limits.

## Why This Matters

Together, these three components create a structured way to manage risks:

1. Know what risks you're willing to take (Appetite)
2. Set specific limits on those risks (Tolerance)
3. Take action to stay within those limits (Mitigation)

This approach keeps organizations moving forward while staying protected.
