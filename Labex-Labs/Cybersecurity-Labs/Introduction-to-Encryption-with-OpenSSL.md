## Lab Overview

### Objectives
- Install and verify OpenSSL
- Create and encrypt sensitive data
- Perform symmetric encryption with AES-256-CBC
- Decrypt encrypted files
- Understand importance of key management

---

## Part 1: Installing OpenSSL

### Installation Commands (Pro Users)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssl -y
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
openssl version
```

**Output:**
```
OpenSSL 3.0.2 15 Mar 2022 (Library: OpenSSL 3.0.2 15 Mar 2022)
```

---

## Part 2: Creating a Secret Message

### Setup Working Directory

```bash
cd ~/project
```

### Create Message File

```bash
echo "LabEx has the best labs for fun, hands-on learning." > secret.txt
```

### Verify File Contents

```bash
cat secret.txt
```

**Output:**
```
LabEx has the best labs for fun, hands-on learning.
```

**Current State:** Message stored in plaintext (readable by anyone)

---

## Part 3: Encrypting the Message

### Encryption Command

```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in secret.txt -out secret.enc -pbkdf2
```

### Command Breakdown

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `openssl enc` | Invoke encryption function |
| `-aes-256-cbc` | Encryption algorithm (AES with 256-bit key) |
| `-salt` | Add random data for extra security |
| `-in secret.txt` | Input file (plaintext) |
| `-out secret.enc` | Output file (encrypted) |
| `-pbkdf2` | Password-based key derivation function |

### Understanding AES-256-CBC

- **AES:** Advanced Encryption Standard (industry standard)
- **256:** Key length in bits (stronger security)
- **CBC:** Cipher Block Chaining mode

### Password Prompt

When you run the command, you'll be prompted to:
1. Enter encryption password
2. Verify password

**Note:** Terminal won't display characters while typing (security feature)

### Verify Encrypted File

```bash
ls -l secret.enc
cat secret.enc
```

**Result:** Random characters (encrypted binary data)

---

## Part 4: Decrypting the Message

### Decryption Command

```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in secret.enc -out decrypted.txt -pbkdf2
```

### Command Breakdown

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `-d` | Decryption mode |
| `-in secret.enc` | Input file (encrypted) |
| `-out decrypted.txt` | Output file (decrypted) |
| Other parameters | Must match encryption settings |

### Verify Decryption

```bash
cat decrypted.txt
```

**Output:**
```
LabEx has the best labs for fun, hands-on learning.
```

### Compare Original and Decrypted

```bash
diff secret.txt decrypted.txt
```

**No output = Perfect match** (successful decryption)

---

## Part 5: Key Management Importance

### Testing Wrong Password

```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in secret.enc -out wrong.txt -pbkdf2
```

**Action:** Enter incorrect password when prompted

### Check Result

```bash
cat wrong.txt
```

**Output:** Error message or random characters (failed decryption)

### Key Takeaways

**Why This Matters:**
- Even one character difference prevents decryption
- Encryption is completely dependent on the key
- Data remains secure without correct password

**Key Management Best Practices:**
- Store keys securely (separate from encrypted data)
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Implement backup procedures
- Rotate keys periodically (enterprise environments)

---

## Complete Workflow

### File Encryption Process

```bash
# 1. Create message
cd ~/project
echo "LabEx has the best labs for fun, hands-on learning." > secret.txt

# 2. Encrypt with AES-256-CBC
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in secret.txt -out secret.enc -pbkdf2
# Enter password when prompted

# 3. Verify encryption
cat secret.enc  # Shows encrypted data

# 4. Decrypt file
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in secret.enc -out decrypted.txt -pbkdf2
# Enter same password

# 5. Verify decryption
cat decrypted.txt
diff secret.txt decrypted.txt
```

## Understanding Symmetric Encryption

### What is Symmetric Encryption?

- Same key used for both encryption and decryption
- Fast and efficient for large amounts of data
- Key must be shared securely between parties

### Encryption Flow

```
Plaintext → Encryption (with key) → Ciphertext
Ciphertext → Decryption (with key) → Plaintext
```

### File States

| State | File | Readable |
|-------|------|----------|
| Original | secret.txt | Yes (plaintext) |
| Encrypted | secret.enc | No (ciphertext) |
| Decrypted | decrypted.txt | Yes (plaintext) |
