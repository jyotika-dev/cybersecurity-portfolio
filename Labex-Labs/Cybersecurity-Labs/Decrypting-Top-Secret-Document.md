## Verification

### View Decrypted Content

```bash
cat decrypted.txt
```

**Output**:
```
Top secret: Project X launch scheduled for 2025-01-01
```

### Multiple Verification Attempts

Throughout the challenge, multiple decryption attempts were made to ensure correct password and parameters:

```bash
# Attempt 1 - Verify file exists
cat decrypted.txt

# Attempt 2 - Check full file path
cat ~/project/decrypted.txt

# Attempt 3 - Re-decrypt to confirm
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in classified.enc -out decrypted.txt -pbkdf2
```

### Common Issues Encountered

**Bad Decrypt Error**:
```
bad decrypt
80EB0CA5077F0000:error:1C800064:Provider routines:ossl_cipher_unpadblock_generic:bad decrypt
```

**Cause**: Incorrect password entered  
**Solution**: Re-enter exact password: `S3cur3P@ssw0rd!`

## Technical Analysis

### AES-256-CBC Encryption

**AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**:
- 256-bit key length
- Industry-standard symmetric encryption
- Used by governments and enterprises

**CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**:
- Each plaintext block is XORed with previous ciphertext block
- Provides better security than ECB mode
- Requires initialization vector (IV)

### PBKDF2 Key Derivation

**Purpose**: Convert password into cryptographic key

**Benefits**:
- Adds computational cost to brute-force attacks
- Uses salt to prevent rainbow table attacks
- Iterative hashing increases security

**How it works**:
1. Takes password as input
2. Applies salt (random data)
3. Performs multiple hash iterations
4. Generates fixed-length encryption key

---

## Challenge Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

```bash
# 1. Navigate to working directory
cd ~/project

# 2. Verify encrypted file exists
ls -l classified.enc

# 3. Perform decryption
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in classified.enc -out decrypted.txt -pbkdf2

# 4. Enter password when prompted
# Password: S3cur3P@ssw0rd!

# 5. Verify successful decryption
cat decrypted.txt

# 6. Confirm output matches expected result
# Expected: "Top secret: Project X launch scheduled for 2025-01-01"
```

- Generate unique salts per encryption

**Verification**:
- Check file integrity after decryption
- Use checksums or hashes
- Validate decrypted content format
