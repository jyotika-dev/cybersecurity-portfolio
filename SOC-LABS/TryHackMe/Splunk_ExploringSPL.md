# Splunk: Exploring SPL (TryHackMe)

## 🔎 Objective
Hands-on practice with **Search Processing Language (SPL)** in Splunk to query, filter, and analyze logs effectively.  

## 🛠️ Key Learnings
- Used **SPL queries** (`stats`, `table`, `where`) to extract patterns.  
- Learned how to pivot data for incident investigation.  
- Understood how Splunk normalizes logs from different sources.  

## 💡 Insights
- SPL feels very similar to SQL, but optimized for **security log hunting**.  
- Even simple queries can **reveal attack traces** like failed logins or lateral movement attempts.
