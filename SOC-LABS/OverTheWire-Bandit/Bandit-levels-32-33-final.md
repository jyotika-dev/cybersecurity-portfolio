# 🔐 OverTheWire Bandit - Levels 32–33 (Final)

## 📌 Overview
Levels 32–33 represent the **final challenge** of the Bandit wargame, focusing on **advanced shell escape techniques** and **completion of the entire series**. These final exercises demonstrate sophisticated shell manipulation and mark the successful completion of all Bandit levels.

## 🧭 Level Highlights (32 → 33)

### Level 32 → 33
**Goal**: Escape an uppercase shell that converts all input to uppercase.

**Commands / approach**:
```bash
ssh bandit32@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
# Shell converts all input to uppercase
$0  # Execute shell variable $0 (current shell)
whoami
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
```

**Result**: Successfully bypassed uppercase shell restriction and extracted final password.

**Why**: Demonstrates advanced shell escape using positional parameters. The `$0` variable contains the current shell path, allowing execution of a normal shell from within the restricted uppercase environment. This technique showcases deep understanding of shell variables and execution contexts.

### Level 33 → 34
**Goal**: Reach the final level and complete the Bandit wargame series.

**Commands / approach**:
```bash
ssh bandit33@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
ls -al
cat README.txt
# Message: "Congratulations on solving the last level of this game!"
```

**Result**: **🎉 BANDIT WARGAME COMPLETED! 🎉**

**Why**: This level serves as the completion certificate for the entire Bandit series. It represents mastery of fundamental to advanced Linux command-line skills, security concepts, and problem-solving techniques essential for cybersecurity professionals.
