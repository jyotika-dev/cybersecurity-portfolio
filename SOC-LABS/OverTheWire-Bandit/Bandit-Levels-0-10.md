# 🔐 OverTheWire Bandit – Levels 0–10

## 📌 Overview
This section of the Bandit wargame helped me strengthen **Linux fundamentals** that are essential for a SOC Analyst.  
Focus areas included: SSH, file handling, hidden files, string extraction, and encoding/decoding.

## 🛠️ Level Highlights

### Level 0–2
- Learned to connect via **SSH**.  
- Read hidden files and practiced `ls -alps` & `cat`.

### Level 3–5
- Navigating tricky filenames and hidden directories.  
- Used `find` and `file` commands to filter files by type/size.  

### Level 6–8
- Discovered how to locate files by **permissions and ownership**.  
- Strengthened usage of `grep` and `find` together.  

### Level 9–10
- Extracted hidden data using `strings`.  
- Decoded text with `base64`.

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- **Linux commands** (`grep`, `find`, `strings`, `base64`) are extremely powerful in security investigations.  
- SOC Analysts often need to **parse logs, find anomalies, and decode suspicious artifacts** — skills mirrored in these levels.  
- Reinforced habit of documenting commands + outputs clearly.
