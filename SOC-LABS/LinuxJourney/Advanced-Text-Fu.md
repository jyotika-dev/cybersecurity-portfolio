## üîπ Regular Expressions (Regex)

**Regex** is a powerful language for searching and manipulating text based on patterns. It's a fundamental skill for anyone working with data.

| Component | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`.`** | Matches any single character. | `a.t` matches "cat," "hat," "bat" |
| **`*`** | Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character. | `go*l` matches "gl," "gol," "gool" |
| **`^`** | Matches the beginning of a line. | `^Error` matches lines that start with "Error" |
| **`$`** | Matches the end of a line. | `login$` matches lines that end with "login" |
| **`[]`** | Matches any single character within the brackets. | `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter |
| **`[^]`** | Matches any single character NOT in the brackets. | `[^0-9]` matches any non-digit character |
| **`()`** | Groups patterns together. | `(ab)+` matches "ab," "abab," "ababab" |
