# 🕵️ PsExec Hunt Lab (CyberDefenders)

## 🎯 Objective
Investigate lateral movement activity flagged by IDS using PsExec.

## 🔍 Steps
- Analyzed PCAP file in Wireshark
- Traced attacker’s activity through network traffic
- Identified entry point and machines targeted

## 📊 Findings
- Detected PsExec-based lateral movement
- Evidence of attacker using valid credentials for remote execution
- Needed walkthrough help to interpret Wireshark filters (first time)

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- PsExec is common in lateral movement attacks (MITRE ATT&CK T1570)
- Wireshark filters are powerful for network forensic investigation
- Hands-on practice required for mastery of packet-level analysis
