## Summary

Threat actors are actively exploiting a recently patched **7 -Zip remote code execution (RCE)** vulnerability tracked as **CVE-2025-11001**.
The flaw is the **directory traversal issue** triggered through malicious symbolic links in the ZIP files, allowing files to be written outside intended extraction paths.
NHS England confirmed **in-the-wild exploitation**, supported by a publicly available PoC.  
The vulnerability affects **Windows systems running 7-Zip with administrative or service-level privileges**, increasing the security impact.

## Technical Details

**Category / Threat Type**: Vulnerability Exploitation / Remote Code Execution

**Key Facts**:
- Vulnerability: **CVE-2025-11001**, CVSS 7.0 — directory traversal via symbolic link handling.
- Requires **user interaction** (e.g., opening or extracting malicious ZIP).
- Exploit allows writing files outside the extraction directory → potential **arbitrary code execution**.
- Public PoC available; exploitation confirmed by NHS England.

**Target / Scope**:
- 7-Zip versions **21.02 to 24.09**  
- Applicable only on **Windows systems**  
- Higher-risk environments where 7-Zip runs with **administrative or service account privileges**
  
**Impact**:
- Remote Code Execution in the context of a system/account running 7-Zip  
- Arbitrary file write via symbolic-link bypass  
- Potential placement of malicious binaries in privileged directories

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping (Relevant Techniques)

| Phase             | Technique Description                      | ID              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Initial Access    | Drive-by compromise / User execution        | T1204           |
| Execution         | Exploitation for client execution           | T1203           |
| Privilege Abuse   | Abuse of system services / service accounts | T1543           |
| Impact            | Arbitrary code execution                    | T1499 / T1068   |

## My Key Takeaways
- 7-Zip vulnerabilities are high-risk because the tool is widely used across enterprises, IT pipelines, and Windows systems.
- Exploitation requires user interaction, but **PoC availability drastically lowers the barrier for attackers**.
- Attack only becomes severe when **7-Zip runs with elevated privileges**, emphasizing the danger of using file utilities as service accounts.
- Highlights how simple parsing flaws (symbolic link logic) can lead to **full RCE** when chained with privilege misuse.

## Why This Incident Matters

The exploitation of CVE-2025-11001 demonstrates how even commonly trusted tools like 7-Zip can become high-value targets.  
For SOC teams and defenders, this case reinforces the need to:

- Monitor for abnormal file extraction behaviors  
- Patch widely deployed utilities quickly  
- Restrict administrative or service-level use of consumer applications  
- Detect symbolic-link abuse and arbitrary file-write attempts  

This vulnerability also shows how attackers leverage parsing inconsistencies between Linux and Windows filesystems to bypass security checks — an increasingly common technique in software supply chain and RCE attack chains.
