## Task 4: Packet Filtering | Principles

### Filter Types

**Capture Filters** - Filter during capture (before saving)
**Display Filters** - Filter after capture (for viewing)

**Important:** You can't use display filter syntax for capture filters!

### Capture Filter Syntax

```
tcp port 80
host 192.168.1.1
src 10.0.0.1 and port 443
```

### Display Filter Syntax

```
tcp.port == 80
ip.addr == 192.168.1.1
ip.src == 10.0.0.1 && tcp.port == 443
```

### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| == | Equal | ip.src == 10.0.0.1 |
| != | Not equal | tcp.port != 80 |
| > | Greater than | frame.len > 100 |
| < | Less than | ip.ttl < 10 |
| >= | Greater or equal | tcp.port >= 1024 |
| <= | Less or equal | frame.len <= 64 |

### Logical Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| and / && | Logical AND | ip.src == 10.0.0.1 and tcp.port == 80 |
| or / \|\| | Logical OR | tcp.port == 80 or tcp.port == 443 |
| not / ! | Logical NOT | not tcp.port == 80 |

### Filter Toolbar Colors

- **Green** - Valid syntax
- **Red** - Invalid syntax
- **Yellow** - Warning (valid but unusual)

---

## Task 5: Packet Filtering | Protocol Filters

### IP Filters

```
ip                    # All IP packets
ip.addr == 10.0.0.1   # Specific IP (source or dest)
ip.src == 10.0.0.1    # Source IP
ip.dst == 10.0.0.1    # Destination IP
```

### TCP/UDP Filters

```
tcp.port == 80        # TCP port 80
udp.port == 53        # UDP port 53
tcp.srcport == 443    # TCP source port
tcp.dstport == 80     # TCP destination port
```

### Application Protocol Filters

**HTTP:**
```
http                          # All HTTP
http.request.method == GET    # HTTP GET requests
http.response.code == 200     # HTTP 200 responses
```

**DNS:**
```
dns                          # All DNS
dns.qry.type == 1           # DNS A records
dns.qry.name contains "google"  # DNS queries with "google"
```

### Display Filter Expression

Can't remember the filter? Use the builder:
```
Analyze â†’ Display Filter Expression
```

### Questions

**What is the number of IP packets?**
```
Filter: ip
```
- Answer: `81420`

**What is the number of packets with TTL value less than 10?**
```
Filter: ip.ttl < 10
```
- Answer: `66`

**What is the number of packets using TCP port 4444?**
```
Filter: tcp.port == 4444
```
- Answer: `632`

**What is the number of HTTP GET requests sent to port 80?**
```
Filter: http.request.method == GET && tcp.port == 80
```
- Answer: `527`

**What is the number of type A DNS queries?**
```
Analyze â†’ Display Filter Expression
Expand DNS, find query type filter
Filter: dns.qry.type == 1
```
- Answer: `51`

## Task 6: Advanced Filtering

### Advanced Filter Functions

**contains** - Search for text in packet
```
http.server contains "Apache"
```

**matches** - Regex pattern matching
```
http.host matches "\.(com|net)$"
```

**in** - Check if value is in a set
```
tcp.port in {80 443 8080}
```

**upper** - Convert to uppercase
```
upper(http.server) contains "APACHE"
```

**lower** - Convert to lowercase
```
lower(http.host) contains "google"
```

**string** - Convert to string for regex
```
string(ip.ttl) matches "[02468]$"  # Even TTL
```

### Bookmarks and Buttons

Save frequently used filters:
```
Bookmark icon in filter toolbar
Or create filter buttons for one-click access
```

### Profiles

Create different profiles for different tasks:
```
Edit â†’ Configuration Profiles
Or bottom right status bar â†’ Profile
```

### Questions

**Find all Microsoft IIS servers. What is the number of packets that did NOT originate from port 80?**
```
Filter: http.server contains "IIS" && tcp.srcport != 80
```
- Answer: `21`

**Find all Microsoft IIS servers with version 7.5. What is the number of packets?**
```
Filter: http.server contains "IIS" && http.server contains "7.5"
```
- Answer: `71`

**What is the total number of packets that use ports 3333, 4444, or 9999?**
```
Filter: tcp.port == 3333 or tcp.port == 4444 or tcp.port == 9999
```
- Answer: `2235`

**What is the number of packets with even TTL numbers?**
```
Filter: string(ip.ttl) matches "[02468]$"
```
- Answer: `77289`

**Change profile to "Checksum Control". What is the number of Bad TCP Checksum packets?**
```
Edit â†’ Configuration Profiles â†’ Checksum Control
Analyze â†’ Expert Information
```
- Answer: `34185`

**Use the existing filtering button to filter traffic. What is the number of displayed packets?**
```
Click the filter button at top right
```
- Answer: `261`
