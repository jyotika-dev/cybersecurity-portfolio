## Introduction

Wireshark is an open-source network packet analyzer tool used for sniffing and investigating live traffic and packet captures (PCAP files).

**What you'll learn:**
- Wireshark GUI and interface
- Packet dissection and analysis
- Navigating through packets
- Filtering and exporting data
- Following streams

**Files:**
- `http1.pcapng` - For following screenshots
- `Exercise.pcapng` - For answering questions

## Task 1: Introduction

### What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is a powerful tool for:
- Detecting network problems
- Finding security anomalies
- Investigating protocols
- Analyzing network traffic

**Important:** Wireshark is NOT an IDS - it only reads packets, doesn't modify them.

### Questions

**Which file is used to simulate the screenshots?**
- Answer: `http1.pcapng`

**Which file is used to answer the questions?**
- Answer: `Exercise.pcapng`

## Task 3: Packet Dissection

### OSI Layers in Packets

Packets consist of 5-7 layers based on the OSI model:

**Layer 3 - Source [IP]** - IP addresses (Network)

**Layer 4 - Protocol** - TCP/UDP ports (Transport)

**Protocol Errors** - TCP reassembly info

**Layer 5 - Application Protocol** - HTTP, FTP, SMB, etc.

**Application Data** - Specific protocol data
