# 🕵️ TryHackMe – Intro to Detection Engineering

## 📌 Overview
This lab introduced the **concept of Detection Engineering**, a critical SOC skill that focuses on designing, testing, and refining threat detections to identify malicious activity effectively.  

I explored the **frameworks, methodologies, and practical approaches** that detection engineers use to stay ahead of adversaries.

## 🔑 Key Learnings
1. **What is Detection Engineering?**
   - The art and science of building reliable detections for threats in a system.
   - Balances between **false positives** and **false negatives** to ensure high-quality alerts.

2. **Methodologies**
   - Iterative process: **Hypothesis → Develop Detection → Test → Validate → Deploy → Monitor → Improve.**
   - Continuous feedback loop improves accuracy and reduces noise.

3. **Frameworks**
   - Learned about structured approaches like:
     - **MITRE ATT&CK** → Maps attacker behaviors into tactics and techniques.
     - **Detection Maturity Level (DML) model** → Measures detection coverage and effectiveness.
     - **SIGMA rules** → Standard format for detections, portable across SIEMs.

4. **Hands-On Insight**
   - Explored practical scenarios for mapping attacker behaviors to detections.
   - Saw how structured frameworks can make SOC detections **scalable and standardized**.

## 💡 My Insights
- Detection Engineering is **not just creating alerts** — it’s about crafting **reliable, testable, and meaningful detections**.  
- Without structured frameworks (MITRE, Sigma, etc.), SOC alerts often become **noisy and ineffective**.  
- Strong detections = less burnout for analysts + quicker response to real threats.  

---

## 📅 Next Steps
- Explore **MITRE ATT&CK techniques** more deeply and practice mapping detections.  
- Write basic **Sigma rules** and experiment in open-source SIEM tools.  
- Continue with advanced detection-focused labs to build a **portfolio of detection engineering projects**.
