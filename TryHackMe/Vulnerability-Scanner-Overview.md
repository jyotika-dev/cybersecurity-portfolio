## Task 1: What Are Vulnerabilities?

### What is a Vulnerability?

A vulnerability is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by attackers.

**Examples:**
- Outdated software
- Weak passwords
- Misconfigurations
- Unpatched systems

### Fixing Vulnerabilities

The process of fixing vulnerabilities is called **patching**.

**Patching includes:**
- Updating software
- Applying security fixes
- Closing security holes
- Configuring systems properly

### Questions

**What is the process of fixing the vulnerabilities called?**
- Answer: `Patching`

---

## Task 2: Vulnerability Scanning

### Types of Vulnerability Scans

### 1. Authenticated vs Unauthenticated

**Authenticated Scanning:**
- Uses credentials to log in
- Scans from inside perspective
- Identifies what an insider could exploit
- More thorough results

**Unauthenticated Scanning:**
- No credentials needed
- Scans from outside perspective
- Shows what external attacker sees
- Limited access

### 2. Internal vs External

**Internal Scanning:**
- Scans inside the network
- Identifies insider threats
- Tests internal systems

**External Scanning:**
- Scans from outside network
- Identifies perimeter vulnerabilities
- Tests public-facing systems

**External scan targets:**
- Public websites
- Network perimeter (open ports)
- Outdated software
- Unsecured APIs
- Misconfigurations

### Questions

**Which type of vulnerability scans require the credentials of the target host?**

Uses credentials = Authenticated

- Answer: `Authenticated scanning`

---

**Which type of vulnerability scan focuses on identifying the vulnerabilities that can be exploited from outside the network?**

Outside network = External

- Answer: `External`

---

| Nessus | Tenable | Commercial |
| Nexpose | Rapid7 | Commercial |
| OpenVAS | Greenbone | Open-source |

### Questions

**Is Nessus currently an open-source vulnerability scanner? (Yea/Nay)**

Nessus is now commercial, not open-source!

- Answer: `Nay`

---

**Which company developed the Nexpose vulnerability scanner?**
- Answer: `Rapid7`

---

**What is the name of the open-source vulnerability scanner developed by Greenbone Security?**
- Answer: `OpenVAS`

---

## Task 4: CVE & CVSS

### CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

**What is CVE?**
- Standardized list of vulnerabilities
- Each vulnerability gets unique ID
- Format: CVE-YEAR-NUMBER

**Example:** CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell)

**Who created it?**
MITRE Corporation

**Purpose:**
- Standardize vulnerability names
- Make communication easier
- Create common reference

### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

**What is CVSS?**
Scoring system to rate vulnerability severity.

**Score Range:** 0.0 - 10.0

### CVSS Severity Levels

| Score | Severity |
|-------|----------|
| 0.0 | None |
| 0.1 - 3.9 | Low |
| 4.0 - 6.9 | Medium |
| 7.0 - 8.9 | High |
| 9.0 - 10.0 | Critical |

### Questions

**CVE stands for?**
- Answer: `Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures`

---

**Which organization developed CVE?**
- Answer: `MITRE Corporation`

---

**What would be the severity level of the vulnerability with a score of 5.3?**

5.3 falls in 4.0 - 6.9 range = Medium

- Answer: `Medium`

---

## Task 5: OpenVAS

### Understanding OpenVAS Reports

OpenVAS generates detailed scan reports showing:
- Discovered vulnerabilities
- Severity levels
- Affected hosts
- Remediation suggestions

### Reading Scan Results

**Key information:**
- Target IP address
- Number of vulnerabilities
- Severity distribution
- Vulnerability details

### Questions

**What is the IP address of the machine scanned in this task?**

Look at the scan report image to find the target IP.

- Answer: `10.10.154.44`

---

**How many vulnerabilities were discovered on this host?**

Count the total vulnerabilities in the scan report.

- Answer: `13`

---

## Task 6: Practical Exercise

### The Scenario

A security team scanned a critical server using OpenVAS. You need to review the vulnerability report.

**Your task:**
- Open the report on desktop
- Review findings
- Answer questions

### Analyzing the Report

**Look for:**
- High severity vulnerabilities
- CVSS scores
- Recommended solutions

---

### Question 1: High Severity Score

**What is the score of the single high-severity vulnerability found in the scan?**

**Steps:**
1. Open vulnerability report
2. Filter by "High" severity
3. Check CVSS score

The highest possible score = Critical

- Answer: `10`

---

### Question 2: Suggested Solution

**What is the solution suggested by OpenVAS for this vulnerability?**

**Steps:**
1. Look at high severity vulnerability
2. Find "Solution" section
3. Read recommendation

The solution for weak credentials is straightforward.

- Answer: `Change the password of the mentioned account(s).`

## Quick Reference

### Vulnerability Severity Levels

| Score Range | Severity | Priority |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| 9.0 - 10.0 | Critical | Fix immediately |
| 7.0 - 8.9 | High | Fix urgently |
| 4.0 - 6.9 | Medium | Schedule fix |
| 0.1 - 3.9 | Low | Fix when possible |

### Scan Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Authenticated | Uses credentials, deep scan |
| Unauthenticated | No credentials, surface scan |
| Internal | Inside network |
| External | Outside network |

### Popular Scanners
